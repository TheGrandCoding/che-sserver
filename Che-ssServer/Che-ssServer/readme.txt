| Because everything is easier when its someone else's code. |
|============================================================|

An example of how things might work:

function ServerStarted() {
    var MASTERLIST = new MasterlistServer(false, "abdul-ttt");
    MASTERLIST.LogMessage += MessageHandler;
    MASTERLIST.RecieveMessage += MessageRecieved;

    if(MASTERLIST.Enabled) {
        MASTERLIST.HostServer("Server #1", LoadGuid());   
    }
}

function PlayerJoinedOrLeft() {
    ## Function called when a player joins, or when they leave
    MASTERLIST.Update("Server #1", GetPlayerCount(), false);
}

function MessageRecieved(string message) {

    if(message == "GetDetails") {
        ## This can be ignored.
        ## GetDetails is used to 
        ## confirm the server is
        ## still online.
    } else if(...)
        ## Other implementations vary
        ## For example, the Drawing client
        ## allows for a detailed status info
        ## Whereas other games dont.
}

Things to remember:

The "server_identifier" is generated by you (for now).
It allows you to continue running a Server that has just closed
If a server is closed, it remains on the Masterlist for ~3 minutes
However, it will not appear to 'GET_SERVER' requests, so clients wont
be able to join.

Additionally, I intend to add a documentation page to https://masterlist.http80.info/documentation/

Good luck.
